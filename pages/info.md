But I finally focused long enough to finish this project.

For a while now, this site was hosted via Wordpress on a web server I rented. I decided it was time for change after a successful implementation of my [business'](https://thackerbroadcasting.com) website that was built through MkDocs and hosted on Github Pages. So here we are.

## Personal

So who am I? What do I do?

I'm a 22-year-old who loves doing a lot of different things. Actively serving in the US Air Force has allowed me to persue my degree in Cloud Computing. In addition, I run my own [media production company](https://thackerbroadcasting.com), [stream](https://twitch.tv/thackmaster69) occasionally, and dabble in some [light programming](https://github.com/thackmaster), specifically web development. In addition to all of this, I enjoy...

- Photography
- Hiking
- Snowboarding/Skiing
- Camping
- Photo/Video Editing
- Audio Production

I know, it's a lot. But I enjoy it. Taking problems and finding solutions to them is fun to me (call me a masochist I guess). Everyone is different. And this is me.
