I’m Wesley Thacker, a 22-year-old who loves doing a lot of different things. I’m actively serving in the US Air Force as a Cyber System Operator, own and operate my own [media production company](https://www.thackerbroadcasting.com), [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/thackmaster69), and [dabble in programming](https://github.com/thackmaster/) with Angular and JavaScript. In addition to all of this, my hobbies involve photography, spending time outdoors hiking, swimming, skiing, snowboarding, camping, web design, photo and video editing and audio production.

I enjoy taking problems and finding solutions to them, whether that involve using tools that already exist or by creating ones that need to exist.
